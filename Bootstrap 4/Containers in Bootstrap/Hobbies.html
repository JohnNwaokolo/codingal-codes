    <h1>Hobbies</h1> 
    Based on Codingal's request, I am going to compile a list of my hobbies. Although,
    I don't really know what they want me to do but I will try my best.

        1.<mark>Coding</mark>is one of my favorite hobbies. 
        When I encounterd codingal, it was a dream come true. I can now use coding 
        elements like <code>div h1 span code </code> and others. I love it.

        2. <mark>Watching  Movies </mark> is another one of my hobbies. I love watching
        anime too. Anime's like <dl>

            <dt>Jujitsu Kaisen</dt>
            <dt>Classroom of the Elites</dt> and many more.
